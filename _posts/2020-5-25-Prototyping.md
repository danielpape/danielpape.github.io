title: Why prototyping is the most important skill for designers
---

When I was learning how to code and design websites, there was a really important skill that I learned, and that was how to take the source code of a website and use that as a the base for the start of a new website.

It was incredibly easy to go to a well designed website and view the source, copy and paste it into a test editor and then change the copy and images and create your own website based entirely on the structure of the other website. And it was great, it means that learning how to create a website was so much simpler than having to learn it all from scratch.

Of course now I am much more skilled and find much more value from designing my own components, but it was a really good skill to learn: fake it until you can make it

And the same is very much true of designing websites, and one that I have had to learn now that I can very quickly knock together a raect prototype for a component I am designing. The design tools have improved so much over the past few years that it is a completely different situation to what we previously had. You can now incorporate so much into a prototype that the pixels that are presented to the user are completely indesitiguishable from the final product.

My current workflow is to design in Sketch, put together a simple prototype in Figma and more complex interactions in Principle and then for larger projects build a full prototype in React.
